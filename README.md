# Countryballs: Evolution
A game about every historical era of Greece. 
It is a historical clicker that contains different industrial/residential homes to replicate how all of them developed throughout history. 46 historical ages are currently present!

- 9 in the Early Ages
- 10 in the Ancient Greece
- 8 in the Medieval Ages
- 10 in the New Ages (starting from Renaissance till WWI)
- 9 in the Modern Ages (WWI - development of AI and ChatGPT) 

-> This game is a collection of conducted historical research and can be seen as educational.

Corresponding transport (planes, cars, ships) are present, and also several in-game bonuses to make the game more interesting (e. g. the clock on the photo below).

## Initial Concept

Initially, I considered the game to have a "happiness-meter" that would be measured by how satisfied the residents of the village are. However, later I came to a conclusion of this being too complicated and unclear to the user (UX) so I put a stronger emphasis on each building giving coins, rather than the former system (residents being assigned to buildings to work as more workers = more coins per click, and also more happiness).
